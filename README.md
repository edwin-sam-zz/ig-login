# Getting Started with Edwin's Ruggable Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To open the application, navigate to: http://instagram-login.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sign-in

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 'nodemon server.js'

This runs our server. This will give you the ability to save to Database when creating a new user and quering our database when the user attempts to login

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
